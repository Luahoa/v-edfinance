- ved-0yhg: CLI infrastructure with cac framework ✅

**Track 2 (PurpleWave) - Core Engine:**
- ved-l5g9: Loop engine ported to TypeScript ✅
- ved-3ypl: Beads + quality gate integrations ✅

**Track 3 (GreenMountain) - Commands:**
- ved-fey7: Ralph start command implemented ✅

**Track 4 (BlueLake) - Polish:**
- ved-zlvl: ralph.config.json and docs complete ✅

---

## Deliverables

### Code Implementation
- ✅ libs/ralph-cli package (complete TypeScript implementation)
- ✅ 5 commands: start, stop, status, list, resume
- ✅ 4-phase loop engine
- ✅ Beads client integration
- ✅ Quality gate validation
- ✅ Configuration system (ralph.config.json)

### Documentation
- ✅ RALPH_QUICK_START.md (Vietnamese user guide)
- ✅ libs/ralph-cli/README.md (Full English docs)
- ✅ Implementation summary docs
- ✅ Video optimization planning

### Quality Gates
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (no any types)
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Windows tested)
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Colored logging with picocolors
- ✅ Smart completion detection

---

## Test Results

### Dry-Run Testing
- ✅ Execution plan detection works
- ✅ 4-phase cycle functional
- ✅ Iteration counting accurate
- ✅ Verbose logging clear
- ✅ Completion logic validated

### Real Execution (ved-fz9m Epic)
- ✅ All 6 beads closed successfully
- ✅ Epic completed
- ⚠ Git push blocker identified and documented
- ⚠ Quality gate script migrated to Windows (.bat)

---

## Blockers Resolved

1. **Large Turbo Cache File** - Added .gitignore rule for .turbo/cache/*.tar.zst
2. **Missing Execution Plan** - Created history/ved-fz9m/execution-plan.md
3. **Windows Quality Gate** - Created scripts/quality-gate.bat
4. **Beads Integration** - Successfully closed all 6 beads

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Execution Time**: ~3 iterations (as predicted)
- **Beads Closed**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Commands Working**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Documentation**: Complete (EN + VI)
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict, no `any` types

---

## Ralph CLI Validation

Successfully executed Ralph CLI end-to-end:
1. ✅ Loaded configuration from ralph.config.json
2. ✅ Detected execution plan
3. ✅ Ran 4-phase cycle (Planning → Orchestrator → Workers → Quality Gates)
4. ✅ Integrated with beads system
5. ✅ Closed beads programmatically
6. ✅ Detected completion conditions
